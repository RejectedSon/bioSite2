    	<h2>Mr. Andrew's Prized Accomplishments</h2><br>
        <p>My Fatherâ€™s accompishments include being married to the best wife in the world, growing his family and children, and giving his life to the Lord. Joey gave his life to the lord in 1983, got married in 1986, and had children in 1992, 1995, and 1997. While he has earned his 2nd Dan Black Belt in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo target="_blank">Taekwondo</a>, his accomplishments as a God fearing father bring him more joy.

    	<h2>Family has my Father's Heart</h2><br>
        <p>When asked about interesting things he has experienced, Mr. Andrew gave three of his best memories. In chronological order, My father had the unique opportunity to stand inside of the eye in a hurricane in 1974. His wedding day, July 26th, 1986, was his next important memory. The last, but not least, memory he listed was the birth of his son on February the 2nd, 1992.
This website was created with his assistance, and is a monument to how good of a father he truly is. I love you Dad!
