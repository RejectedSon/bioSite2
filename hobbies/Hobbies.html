    	<h2>Enjoying Time with Family</h2><br>
        <p>In my father's spare time, he enjoys the time he gets to spend with his family. Whether it is spending time around the home, working outside, or going on <a href=https://www.sixflags.com/ target="_blank">vacations</a>, Mr. Andrew prefers to do things with his family over anyone else. Of the people in his world, his family is the most important to him.

Joey Andrew has a thirst for knowledge, and loves to learn of history and of God's creatures around him. Of all the places he has been, he remembers the ones he visisted with his family the most.

    	<h2>God's Animals</h2><br>
        <p>On our travels, the Andrew family has seen a great many different animals in different zoos and aquariums across the country. Of these, my father has enjoyed <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_dart_frog target="_blank">poison dart frogs</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly#:~:text=Butterflies%20(Rhopalocera)%20are%20insects%20that,and%20Papilionoidea%20(all%20others). target="_blank">butterflies</a> of all varieties, and the <a href=https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Ruby-throated_Hummingbird/overview target="_blank">ruby throated hummingbird</a> the most. He enjoys the bright colors of the frogs, the beauty of the butterfly, and the magestic flight patterns that Hummingbirds can take. As a hobby at home, Mr. Andrew has several hummingbird feeders that he enjoys watching during down time.
