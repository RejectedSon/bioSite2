    	<h2>Welcome to Joey Andrew's Bio Site!</h2><br>
        <p> This site was created by Benjamin Andrew as a project for CSD-340, taught by Joseph Issa. This website is to show how good of a father Joey Andrew is, as well as some of the things his son Benjamin has learned about HTML and CSS. This webpage includes this landing page, an about page that includes Mr. Andrew's accomplishments and experiences, as well as a hobbies page that goes into detail about some of the many things my loving father is passionate about.

    	<h2>Parts, Power, and Passion</h2><br>
        <p>Mr. Andrew, after gaining his B.S. in Electrical Engineering began to work for a large engineering firm. At the time, they had been tasked with updating the CH-47 cargo helicopter. This was the start of a fruitful career for Mr. Andrew, as he followed this calling from company to company. This project, sadly, is finally coming to a close after 30+ years of work!
